/*
The camera has disadvantages. 
The camera is a very bad imitation of the HW0054 camera. 
The camera is not compatible with ONVIF. 
The configuration from the web browser is different than from the Android application. 
PTZ control from a web browser has errors, it is reverse. Instead of down is up, instead of left is right. 
After a month the sound broke. 
The purchase was a waste of money.
